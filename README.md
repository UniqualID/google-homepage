# google-homepage
(attempted) Clone of google homepage using html/css. Non-responsive.

### Here's what it looks like on a 1980 x 1080 resolution screen.

 It looks funky in other resolutions because I hard coded values for spacers on the top and bottom navbar(correct term?) things. Will come back and fix once I learn more than just html/css. That's a promise!
